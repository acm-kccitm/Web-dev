# Getting start with Web-Development.
By **Shibam Dhar(soulhunter)**

## Web development
Everything on internet which a person see and interact with; all the websites are because of web-development. Web development mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding and writing markup. Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex web-based applications, social network applications, and electronic business applications.

To get start with web designing, a person have to think about a structure of a web-page. Keeping in mind that how to present the the contents of the web-page and how to make the the page attractive as well as interactive.

## Front-end and Back-end
The terms **“front end”** and **“back end”**  describe what part of the client/server relationship you’re working with.

“Front end” means that you’re dealing mainly with the client side. It’s called the “front end” because it’s what you can see in the browser. Conversely, the “back end” is the part of the website that you can’t really see, but it handles a lot of the logic and functionality that is necessary for everything to work.


 
## Code – Editor
When you build a website, the most essential tool that you will use is your code editor or **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**. This tool allows you to write the markup and code that will make up the website.

A best-fit code editor will make any developer more efficient at writing code. It will be a personal assistant helping examine code for less mistakes and show where edits need to be made. And, just as importantly, it will need to be customisable, allowing for the creation of a custom UI and an intuitive user experience. This is critical as you will most likely be looking at your code editor screen for hours on end. 

Some of the best code editors –

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)<br>
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)<br>
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)<br>
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)<br>

## Basic-Fronted
The front-end of a website is made up of three types of files:

- HTML<br>
- CSS<br>
- JavaScript<br>

### HTML

While designing a web-page, things should go sequentially.First about what all contents are needed to be displayed and where to be displayed on the screen. It is also known as building up the skeleton of the web-page. HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language) does this part,which is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.


 
### CSS

Then comes to attractiveness of the content on the web-page. All the alignments and fanciness of the content as well as giving animations to the web-page. This is done with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. To have a very good web-page one must have a strong hand over CSS skills.

### JavaScript

Finally, we have to see that how our web-page is responding to the user. For example when clicked on “Back to Top” button on the web-page, whether the page really scroll back up to the top of the page or not. This is done by JavaScript which is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser. Using JavaScript, we can make our website dynamic, meaning it will respond to different inputs from the user, or other sources.
